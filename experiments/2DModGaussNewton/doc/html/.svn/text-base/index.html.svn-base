         <h1>Modified gauss-newton full-waveform inversion</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>This software release includes an parallel framework in Matlab for modified gauss-newton (GN) full-waveform inversion [1,2],
               which based on the ideas from compressive-sensing and stochastic optimization, where the GN updates are computed from random
               subsets of the data via curvelet-domain sparsity-promotion. There are two different subset sampling strategies are considered
               in this package: randomized source encoding, and drawing sequential shots firing at random source locations from marine data
               with missing near and far offsets. In both cases, we obtain excellent inversion results compared to conventional methods at
               reduced computational costs. There is also a small example based on Camembert example which can allow users to test the algorithm
               in a short time
