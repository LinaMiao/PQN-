% This example produce the result from Modified Gauss-Newten Full-waveform
% inversion.
% -----------------------------------------------
%
% In this example, we process FWI from low frequency band to high frequency
% band. 10 GN subproblems are solved for each frequency band which contains 
% 10 frequencies. For each GN subproblem, we use 7 randomly selected simultaneous
% shots and roughly 20 L1 solver iterations
% 
% We sugguest you run this script with parallel matlab, 10 workers will be the best
%
% Results will be saved as a mat file under results directory.
