This folder include all the results which all saved as MAT format

View result:
	you can use 'ResultDisp' to view the result interactively, or you can use following
	way.
	1, go to subfolder, e.g 'example_BG'
	2, load 'FWIresult*.mat' file into matlab. If you haven't run any

	3, After load the data, u will get 3 variables, 'results', 'updates', 'resultinfo'.
		'results' and 'updates' are 3D data cube; first two axis is depth and lateral,
		while the 3rd axis is GN iteration. Then you can use matlab display functions
